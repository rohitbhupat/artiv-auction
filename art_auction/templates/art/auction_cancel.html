        <h2 class="fw-bold">General Policy</h2>
        <p>At ARTIV, we strive to provide a seamless auction experience for both buyers and sellers. Due to the nature of online auctions, cancellations are subject to strict guidelines to maintain fairness and transparency.</p>
        
        <h2 class="fw-bold">Bidding Cancellations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Once a bid is placed, it cannot be cancelled unless due to a technical error or fraudulent activity.</li>
            <li>ARTIV reserves the right to cancel bids if found to be in violation of our platform’s terms, such as fake bidding or price manipulation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="fw-bold">Seller Cancellations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sellers can withdraw an artwork before any bids are applied.</li>
            <li>Once a bid is applied to an artwork, cancellations are not permitted unless due to unforeseen circumstances such as damage or loss of the artwork.</li>
            <li>If a seller cancels after an auction ends, penalties may apply, including restrictions on future listings.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="fw-bold">Buyer Cancellations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>After a buyer wins an auction, they will receive a notification: "Do you want to buy this artwork? Respond within 12 hours."</li>
            <li>If the buyer confirms within the 12-hour period, the purchase is legally binding and cannot be cancelled.</li>
            <li>If the buyer fails to respond within 12 hours, ARTIV reserves the right to offer the artwork to the next highest bidder or relist it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="fw-bold">ARTIV-Initiated Cancellations</h2>
        <p>ARTIV reserves the right to cancel auctions, bids, or transactions in cases of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fraudulent activity or rule violations.</li>
            <li>Technical errors affecting auction integrity.</li>
            <li>Unforeseen circumstances affecting the seller’s ability to fulfill the order.</li>
        </ul>
